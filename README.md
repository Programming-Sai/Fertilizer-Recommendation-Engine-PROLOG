Here's an improved version of your project documentation, emphasizing that it's an initial setup and detailing the steps clearly for the users:

# **Fertilizer Recommendation Engine - PROLOG**

This project is an early-stage implementation of a Prolog-based expert system designed to help farmers make fertilizer recommendations based on various factors such as soil types, weather conditions, and crop requirements. Currently, the system is in its initial phase, and the backend serves only a simple "Hello, World!" message. As we continue development, the system will integrate logical inference for making more complex fertilizer recommendations.

## **Prerequisites**

Before running the project locally, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **SWI-Prolog**:  
   This project uses SWI-Prolog as the Prolog interpreter. You can download it from the official website:  
   [SWI-Prolog Downloads](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html)

2. **Web Browser**:  
   A web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari) is required to access the application via a local server.

---

## **Installation Steps**

1. **Clone the repository**:

   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Programming-Sai/Fertilizer-Recommendation-Engine-PROLOG.git
   cd Fertilizer-Recommendation-Engine-PROLOG
   ```

2. **Install SWI-Prolog**:

   If SWI-Prolog isn't installed, follow the installation instructions on the [SWI-Prolog Download page](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html) based on your operating system.

---

## **Running the Project Locally**

### Step 1: Start the Prolog HTTP Server

1. **Launch SWI-Prolog**:

   Open a terminal and type:

   ```bash
   swipl
   ```

2. **Load the Prolog file**:

   Once in the Prolog terminal, load the Prolog file (`hello_world_server.pl`) using:

   ```prolog
   [hello_world_server].
   ```

3. **Start the server**:

   Run the following to start the server:

   ```prolog
   start.
   ```

   The server will be available at `http://localhost:8080`. You'll see a confirmation message in the terminal indicating the server is running.

4. **Access the application**:

   Open a browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

   The page should show a "Hello, World!" message, as the root URL currently returns that response.

---

### Step 2: Restarting the Server

- If you make any changes to the Prolog code and need to restart the server, run:

  ```prolog
  restart.
  ```

  This stops the server, reloads the Prolog files, and restarts it with the updated code.

---

### Step 3: Stopping the Server

- To stop the Prolog HTTP server, run:

  ```prolog
  stop.
  ```

  This will terminate the HTTP server.

---

### Step 4: Stopping the Entire Application

- To stop the entire application, including the Prolog process, run:

  ```prolog
  halt.
  ```

  This will exit the `swipl` instance completely.

---

## **How the System Works (Current State)**

- **Initial Setup**:  
   The current version of the system is set up with SWI-Prolog’s HTTP server library. At this stage, when you visit the root URL (`http://localhost:8080`), it calls the `say_hello/1` predicate, which simply returns a "Hello, World!" message.

- **Future Updates**:  
   Future versions will integrate the logic for fertilizer recommendations based on a set of rules and facts related to soil, weather, crop types, and fertilizers. This current setup provides the foundational structure for handling HTTP requests and will evolve into a full-fledged expert system.

---

## **Next Steps (What’s Coming)**

- **Fertilizer Recommendations**:  
   We'll add rules for fertilizer recommendations based on soil pH, crop requirements, and weather patterns.

- **APIs**:  
   The backend will expose APIs to allow the frontend to interact with the system, send user data, and receive fertilizer suggestions.

---

This documentation provides the basics for getting started with the project. Since we are just beginning, expect more functionality to be added as the system evolves. Stay tuned for future updates where we will dive into the expert system logic for fertilizer recommendations.
